"""
assuming we get about 10k tracks from the 50 playlists we pull for the genre,
and it takes 90 seconds to get those tracks, plus another 30 seconds for the features,
plus another 30 seconds to get all the artists and then another 3 minutes for all the albums

so it should take about 6 minutes to get all the data for about 10k songs.

I think we should be able to put each genre into a lambda to scale this out. can't have them all running at the same time though because then we will probably get rate limited
